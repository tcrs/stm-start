# Requirements

The Makefile expects a checkout of `mbed-os` in this folder. E.g.

```
git clone https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os.git
```

I have tested with git sha `ebeb776de`. Different versions may have moved some
files around, so beware!

# Effect

This example should turn off the LED on the corner of the Arch Max board.
